I started this project by writing everything in JavaScript, and then adding TypeScript to it afterwards. So I would recommend reading through the JS file first, 
and understand what is happening, and then going through the TypeScript file to see how I've modified the code with TypeScript. I've added comments in the TypeScript 
file explaining all the TypeScript code I wrote.
